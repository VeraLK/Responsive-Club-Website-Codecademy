Challenge Project: Company Homepage - ***CodeCademy***
---
Buildng an open-end project for ***CodeCademy*** using the Flexbox layout:

1. The Homepage should include:
  - A title and logo or splash image.
  - A mission statement or brief description of the company.
  - A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
  - A section describing some of the company’s employees or teammates.

2. The project should use flexbox styling for layout. The aim is to use flexbox’s advantages, such as easy horizontal and vertical positioning, flexible element flows as the page size changes, and great styling for repeated elements.

   Used flexbox to:

  -  Create a centered navbar at the top of the page.
  -  Create a flexible display of company products that changes from a more grid-like list to a column list as the page shrinks.
  -  Create a flexible display of company employees.

3. The page should also use custom styles for other properties, such as colors, fonts, and other layout properties such as borders and padding.

Enjoy Coding!!!
