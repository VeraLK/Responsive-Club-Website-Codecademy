         <h3>"Walking on embers barefoot" - an ancient pagan ritual
           or a Christian one associated with St.Constantin & St.Helen ?</h3>
         <p>Nestinarstvo - so-called "walking on embers barefoot" 
             is believed to be a pagan ritual performed by the 
             ancient Thracians. By dancing on the embers, falling
             into a trance, they welcomed the coming summer, 
             praised the name of the Sun god, who carried
             the fire with him, and asked him to grant them health,
             success and fertility during the year.</p>
         <p>In the Christianity the ritual is associated with St.Constantin
             and St.Helen. Their "children" do not burn into fire and see
             the future...The icons of the Saints are kept in a chapel 
             throughout the year but on the day of the Saints - tradtionally
             celebrated on <strong>June 3</strong> (old style) or <strong>
             May 21</strong> (new style) - their followers, the "Nestinari" proceed with the icons to the 
             nearest holy source called "the Great Ayazma". At the same time
             a fire is lit in the center of a village, which is maintained
             all day without letting it go out. When night falls, a "carpet" of burnt wood is spread and barefoot
             dancers take the icon in their hands and in a state of trance,
             to the sounds of bagpipes and drums, dance on the "carpet".

         <blockquote class="second">"Ritual was included in 
            <span>UNESCO</span> intangible cultural heritage in 2009!"
         </blockquote>
         <p>From time immemorial, in the depths of the mystical 
            Strandzha Mountain, live an extraoudnary tribe of Nestinari.
            Forbidden and persecuted, they continue to perform their
            magic rituals...</p>
         <p>When the world dissolves, in the magnificant sounds of
            bagpipes and the heartbeat of drums, the magic starts
            to happen - it seems like the icons, in the hands of 
            Nestinari, come to life and they dance as if a higher power 
            protects them! They come out of it fully unharmed!</p>
         <p>There are things that logic and racional thinking 
            can not fully explain! They can only be felt with 
            heart and soul - if only we leave our established ideas
            of what is possible and overcome the fear of the unknown
            and open our senses to the spiritual world.</p>

            <h3>If you wish to see this incredible ritual, visit <span>the village of Bulgari on June 3th!</span></h3>
            <p>Today, the practice of this ritual, included in 2009 in the UNESCO 
                list of intangible cultural heritage, can be seen
                only in a few villages in the Strandzha Mountain - Bulgari,
                Kosti and Brodilovo on the feast of St.Constantin and St.Helen - June 3th. 
            <p>In the past, the ritual was also performed 
                in Turkey (Bunarhisar) and Greece (Kosti, Agios Ioannis, Urgas, etc.).
                It is believed and the communities which celebrate this ritual are descended refugees who entered
                Greece (after Balcan Wars 1911-1912) and Turkey (after population exchange in 1923) from Eastern Thrace.</p>
            <p>According to early information, the whole Community of Nestinari once lived in a settlement called Pripor (from Greek- "Three passes")
                which was located between the villages of Bulgari, Kosti and Gramatikovo (making a triangle). The Nestinari were specific ethnos between Greeks and Bulgarians - bilingual
                with special customs, different from the surrounding villages.
